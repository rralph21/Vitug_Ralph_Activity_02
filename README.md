- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Package Initialization

## Additional Information

This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts in Python, specifically focusing on abstract classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
The activity includes the implementation of Shape, Triangle, and Rectangle classes, along with unit tests for validation.

Abstraction (ABC) 
   The Shape class was defined as an abstract with methods calculate_area and calculate_perimeter.

Inheritance  
    Both Triangle and Rectangle inherit from Shape

Polymorphism
    Both Triangle and Rectangle shared the same methods but each shape had their own function.
